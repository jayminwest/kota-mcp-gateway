# Nutrition Handler (Alias)

The nutrition handler has been renamed to the **Daily Handler** and now covers food, supplements, substances, activities, and training entries. All `nutrition_*` tools continue to work as aliases.

See [DAILY.md](./DAILY.md) for the up-to-date documentation and examples.
